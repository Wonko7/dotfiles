Conky
=====

Conky is a wonderful system monitor available on Linux systems. This package
sets up Conky with my default configuration file, and also downloads and sets
up the different icons and fints required by the theme to work.

Files
=====

This package has the following files:

  * **conkyrc**: The conkyrc file defines how the conky looks, feels and
behaves. The complete theme for the conky is embedded here.
  * **conky_weather.sh**: A shell script that downloads the weather conditions
from Yahoo weather and saves the relevant XML file for conky to parse and
display the weather.

Others
======

The installer script will also download and install:

  * **Conky_weather_icons**: A set of corrected weather icons for displaying
the current weather conditions on screen.
  * **OpenSans-Light.ttf**: This is a very nice font face used heavily in the
conky config bundled with the package.
